My parents sold me into slavery as a babe, though the practice had been formally abolished in Perth years earlier. As a boy I cut my teeth on the reefs of the Shore of Songs, and lulled the Pale Sea to sleep with many a hymn, that she might return our sailors from the Black Stair unscathed. How the melodies whisked inside my skull even then. I was given no name at birth, but the sailors called me Catu. At five and ten years I ran away. On Ettinspine I roosted with an eremite who ushered me into manhood. I learned to hunt, and laugh, and dream. In time I came to know of the Free City and the ingress afforded my kind. I shoved off from my stony nook, and trekked to their high gate, and settled there, though I preferred to sup with the anglers and other low folk. In a sun-warmed pool under the rampart the Free Seer first noticed me. The slant of his neck from where he watched on the parapet presaged my movements, I still recall. I stood from my bath and shamefully padded to my discarded vest, but stopped. I saw him from that distance, his eyes tucked deep into his shorn dome, his frock as inert as a statue's, and I felt no more shame. Under his tutelage I rose to prominence in his court. I stood by his side as he treated with the tuyuldars of Odrum, as he plotted against the southern freeholds. When a traitorous canter slipped poison into his cup, I smashed it from his hands and sundered the quisling's mind. That night, in the hour of the Beetle Moon, he introduced me to the mirth of an assembled mind. Together with the other canters we Joined, and he named me Mirthful, and raised me unto his honor guard. I would be dispossessed of it in under a year. But I must pause now. The Cant loudens, and the Elder nears. I vow to conclude my story if I still draw breath, and if I am free. It is dusk. I sit on the bank of the River Svy, but no fire warms my bones. The risk of drawing moon-doting beasts is too great, and any aggregation of minds is sure to attract the attention of the Elder. Instead, I write by a flame kindled on my thumb. I left off at being named Mirthful in the Hall of the Free Seer. No honor is higher for a canter of Oth. For months I trained with my masked compatriots beneath the Hall, where our clay cisterns stored the freshwater that would later haunt my dreams. In the spring a letter arrived from the Angler King. He sought a treaty with the Free Seer and invited us to a neutral council on the doorstep of Ibunudr, arbitrated by the tuyuldar of Doria. After much preparation we set out, rowing our sketties beyond the Bowl of Iris and to the frosty shores of that far tundra. Over the course of the journey the Free Seer's disposition soured. He withdrew from the counsel of the Mirthful, even my own, and spent the better part of the wintry trek alone in his tent. At first I attributed his mood to the fragility of our diplomatic high ground, but I soon learned the true tack. We arrived at the camp on Ibunudr on the summer solstice. The twin banners of Athenreach and Doria thrashed in the wind, and the hymns of the Eustace-Sutta carried. I remember smiling at the throaty crooning of their priests. As we studied the campground from a hillock, as the Free Seer ambled up to my side, I saw the jewel of the Hanging Hills, Nisramet, the Angler King's wife, she who cemented the peace between her father's fiefdoms and the Angler King's freehold. I saw her, and I immediately knew my own treachery. The Free Seer's gaze was acknowledgement enough. I've arrived at Kyakukya. Kind Nuntu shares his hut with me, offers me smoked mushroom, and asks nothing in return. I write these words at his desk, and though he lusts for knowledge himself, he leaves me be to chronicle my past. The campaign back toward Oth was grim. I awaited my fate at the Free Seer's hands, though I anticipated being given the dignity of first returning to the Hall and my home. I was not afforded so much. One dismal night, under the Beetle Moon, I was accosted in my tent by my masked brothers. To my bewilderment, the Stithening had come already. How had the Free Seer acquired the cherrydotters? Had he bargained for them at Ibunudr, or had he possessed them all along? To this day I do not know. I remember little of the Stithening outside the beating of my own heart high in my ears. I passed out, and when I awoke next morning, the cavalcade had vanished. Only a moment did my recognition last before the chanting in my head took hold. I had heard it before, of course. All my life, in fact. It was the chanting that I weaved my melodies around on the shores of Perth as a small boy. Now, though, it was as if a single, distant canter had summoned a thousand of his kin, and they each summoned a thousand of their own. I wept, then I screamed, then I tore the hair from my head. The chant animated my bones more surely than my volition ever had. East and south, it urged. East and south. East and south. Toward Qud. My recollection of the voyage to the Great Salt Desert is fractured and fitful. I grew sicker by the day, but the chant grew louder, and so quickened the force that compelled me. Surely I would die once I reached the moistureless plains of Moghra'yi, presumably as had my predecessors before me. Finally, I did reach them, where a salt-churned rivulet dried under a golden arch. The arch seems a thing born of my dementia but that I recall it so vividly, and that I know it's the least of the secrets kept by Moghra'yi. I edge closer to the grove of fungi and its preposterous promise. Are the whispers true? Could it be all so simple? I can feel the moistness of the Eater's flesh on my lips, though the memory is surely another's. If salvation awaits me, then I promise to take it, whether or not I deserve it. Tonight, though, the jungle shrouds me. I sit under a chrome belfry, a leech kneading at my skin. I feel no compulsion to bar its work. The companionship is welcome. Now to awaken the past once more. Moghra'yi. O, how the dromads know! How did I survive the Great Desert? I cannot say for sure. I owe something to the songs I sang at Perth, to the falconry I learned on Ettinspine, to the honing of my sinew under Oth. The fractured dream that was my voyage offers little elucidation. But I do remember chewing salt, and summoning gusts of wind to suck the moisture out of the dead air. Of all the riven memories that churn in my head, Moghra'yi only accounts for a coherent three. The first is a vision of ruin at the fabled Kubrisyeti, the seat of the Wrathchild empire. Stretched across the alabaster plain were the last of their wicked structures, toppled effigies of the manscorpions themselves. I reposed there, against my will and only out of exhaustion. Fixated on the night sky in fear and fatigue, I heard the echoes of a great saltback's steps. Even those gargantuans know to avoid the place. The second memory is the presence of the giants. Colossal skeletons in the forms of humanoids litter the desert. I had heard the accounts before, and indeed some of the specimens extend as far north as Odrum. Their history is wholly unknown to us or anyone else, but their bones provide some of the only shade on the salt pans, and so they grew to be welcome sights. So it was with horror that I discerned a truth, one night, while tucked into the rib cage of one of three cadavers in a small proximity. You see, all the carcasses shared a commonality: their orientation. East and south. East and south. The third memory is the rust. Rusted hulls and rusted spires. It took me weeks to realize what I beheld. For all my boyhood was rife with sketties and ships, but none were of this size. I envisioned what the past must have looked like, as little sense as it made to me. Moghra'yi as a vast sea, and monstrous vessels mounting its waves. Markings and etches on their hulls had no resonance for me then. Later, though, I recognized the figure of the Spindle, and I glimpsed the importance it held for these sea-faring Eaters. When I lurched to the ground and was righted by a brown-skinned man with a knife and glowing cat at his feet, I knew it was a dream. It must be a dream. I owe my life to =SEEKERENEMY=. In my haste to reach the fungal grove, I misstepped. My wandering and buoyant mind blinded itself to the presence of a chosen one. She neared me, set on enveloping me back into the fold, but she was intercepted by =SEEKERENEMY=. For what purpose did they intercede I do not know, but they have my thanks. So must they have the Elder's ire. I come now to Qud and the Seekers of the Sightless Way. The chanting compounded in my skull into a final ecstasy, wherein I joined an aggregate mind the likes of which I hadn't fathomed. I was primed for it, though. From my first joining on Ettinspine all those years ago, to the Rite of Mirth chaperoned by the Free Seer, I knew that sight guides us no more than salt does. There is ecstasy in the aggregate, indeed, and the Elder is as powerful a center as I've known. But a center is it still, and where there is a center, there is a hierarchy. Which piece of my past endowed me with the wisdom to see through the ruse? Was it the boyhood memory of crashing waves on the Shore of Songs, echoed later in my vision at Moghra'yi? Was it the jealousy in the eyes of the Free Seer at Ibunudr? Or was it a mere wrinkle in the mass mind, owing nothing to my own struggle? I cannot say, but while the other canters piped their songs to weaken the Elder's prison, unknowing thralls to a greater mind, I escaped. It must not be forgotten that energy is not a simple factor, but is always a product of two factors--a mass with a velocity, a mass with a temperature, a quantity of electricity into a pressure, and so on. One may sometimes meet the statement that matter and energy are the two realities; both are spoken of as entities. It is much more philosophical to speak of matter and motion, for in the absence of motion there is no energy, and the energy varies with the amount of motion; and furthermore, to understand any manifestation of energy one must inquire what kind of motion is involved. This we do when we speak of mechanical energy as the energy involved in a body having a translatory motion; also, when we speak of heat as a vibratory, and of light as a wave motion. To speak of energy without stating or implying these distinctions, is to speak loosely and to keep far within the bounds of actual knowledge. To speak thus of a body possessing energy, or expending energy, is to imply that the body possesses some kind of motion, and produces pressure upon another body because it has motion. Tait and others have pointed out the fact, that what is called potential energy must, in its nature, be kinetic. Tait says--Now it is impossible to conceive of a truly dormant form of energy, whose magnitude should depend, in any way, upon the unit of time; and we are forced to conclude that potential energy, like kinetic energy, depends(even if unexplained or unimagined) upon motion. All this means that it is now too late tostop with energy as a final factor in any phenomenon, that the _form of  motion_ which embodies the energy is the factor that determines _what_ happens, as distinguished from how _much_ happens. Here, then, are to be found the distinctions which have heretofore been called forces; here is embodied the proof that direct pressure of one body upon another is what causes the latter to move, and that the direction of movement depends on the point of application, with reference to the centre of mass.":"我来自西方。我的父母在我还是婴儿时就把我卖为奴隶，尽管珀斯早在几年前就已经正式废除了这种做法。小时候，我在歌曲之岸的珊瑚礁上磨牙，用许多赞美诗让苍白之海安睡，希望她能毫发无损地将我们的水手从黑阶带回。那时，旋律在我的脑海中回荡。我出生时没有名字，但水手们叫我卡图。十岁那年，我逃跑了。在埃廷斯皮恩，我和一名隐士一起栖息，他引导我进入成年。我学会了狩猎、笑和做梦。随着时间的推移，我得知了自由之城以及给予我们种族的通道。我离开了我的岩石巢穴，跋涉到他们的高门，并定居在那里，尽管我更喜欢与渔民和其他低等民众共进晚餐。在城墙下的暖池中，自由先知第一次注意到我。他从城垛上俯视的姿势预示了我的行动，至今仍历历在目。我从浴缸中站起，羞愧地走向我丢弃的背心，但停了下来。我从远处看到他，他的眼睛深陷在他剃光的头顶下，他的长袍像雕像一样静止，我不再感到羞愧。在他的教导下，我在他的宫廷中崛起。我站在他身边，当他与奥德鲁姆的图伊尔达人谈判时，当他密谋反对南方的自由领地时。当一个叛徒轻率地在他的杯子里下毒时，我把它从他手中打掉，并摧毁了那个叛徒的心智。那天晚上，在甲虫月的时刻，他让我体验了集合心智的欢乐。我们一起加入了其他轻骑兵，他给我取名欢乐者，并提拔我进入他的荣誉卫队。不到一年，我就失去了这个地位。但现在我必须暂停一下。轻骑兵的声音变响了，长老也快到了。我发誓，如果我还活着，如果我是自由的，我会继续讲述我的故事。现在是黄昏。我坐在斯维河岸边，但没有火温暖我的骨头。吸引月光宠爱的野兽的风险太大，任何心智的聚集都肯定会引起长老的注意。相反，我在拇指上点燃了一簇火焰来写作。我上次写到在自由先知的大厅里被命名为欢乐者。对奥瑟的轻骑兵来说，没有比这更高的荣誉了。几个月来，我与戴着面具的同伴们在大厅下训练，我们的陶土水箱储存了后来会出现在我梦中的淡水。春天，渔王寄来一封信。他寻求与自由先知缔结条约，并邀请我们前往伊布努德参加由多利亚的图伊尔达人仲裁的中立会议。经过长时间的准备，我们出发了，划着我们的斯基蒂船穿过虹膜碗，来到远方冰冻的海岸。在整个旅程中，自由先知的心情变得越来越糟。他不再听取欢乐者的建议，甚至不再听取我的建议，大部分时间独自待在他的帐篷里。起初我以为他的情绪是因为我们外交的脆弱地位，但很快我发现了真相。我们在夏至那天到达了伊布努德的营地。雅典里奇和多利亚的双旗在风中飘扬，尤斯塔斯-苏塔的赞美诗传遍四方。我记得我对他们祭司的喉音微笑。当我们从一个小山丘上观察营地时，自由先知漫步到我身边，我看到了悬挂在山上的宝石尼斯拉梅特，渔王的妻子，她巩固了她父亲的领地与渔王的自由领地之间的和平。我看到了她，立刻意识到自己的背叛。自由先知的目光足以证明一切。我已经到达了凯亚库亚。善良的努图与我分享了他的小屋，给我烟熏蘑菇，什么也不要求。我在他的书桌上写下这些文字，虽然他自己渴望知识，但他任由我记录过去。返回奥瑟的战役很惨烈。我在等待自由先知的手中的命运，虽然我预计他会给我尊严，先回到大厅和我的家。但我没有得到这样的机会。一个阴沉的夜晚，在甲虫月，我在帐篷里被戴面具的兄弟们袭击。令我惊讶的是，紧缩已经开始了。自由先知是如何获得樱桃点的？他在伊布努德交易了吗，还是早就拥有了？直到今天我也不知道。我几乎记不清紧缩之外的事情，除了我耳朵里的心跳声。我昏倒了，第二天早上醒来时，车队已经消失了。我的认知只持续了一瞬间，接着脑子里的吟唱就占据了主导。当然，我以前听过。事实上，我的一生都在听。那是我在珀斯岸边编织旋律的小男孩时听到的吟唱。现在，仿佛一个遥远的轻骑兵召唤了一千个同类，而每个同类又召唤了一千个自己的同类。我哭了，然后尖叫，然后扯下了头上的头发。吟唱比我的意志更有力地激活了我的骨骼。向东向南，它催促着。向东向南。向东向南。朝向库德。我对前往大盐沙漠的航行的记忆支离破碎。我一天天变得更病弱，但吟唱却变得更响亮，于是驱使我前行的力量也加快了。一旦到达干燥的莫格拉伊平原，我肯定会死，就像我的前辈们一样。终于，我到达了那里，一条盐化的溪流在金色拱门下干涸。拱门似乎是我痴呆的产物，但因为我记得如此清晰，而且我知道这只是莫格拉伊所保守的秘密中最微不足道的一个。我靠近了真菌林及其荒谬的承诺。传言是真的吗？事情真的那么简单吗？我可以感觉到食者肉的湿润在我的唇上，尽管这段记忆肯定是别人的。如果有救赎等待着我，无论我是否配得上，我都发誓要接受。但今晚，丛林笼罩着我。我坐在铬钟楼下，一只水蛭正在按摩我的皮肤。我没有任何阻止它的冲动。这种陪伴是受欢迎的。现在再次唤醒过去。莫格拉伊。哦，那些骆驼都知道!我是如何在大沙漠中幸存下来的？我不能确定。我欠了一些债给我在珀斯唱的歌，欠了一些债给我在埃廷斯皮恩学的猎鹰术，欠了一些债给我在奥瑟磨练的肌肉。我的支离破碎的梦境之旅提供的解释很少。但我记得嚼盐，召唤风吸走死气中的水分。在我脑海中翻腾的所有破碎的记忆中，莫格拉伊只能解释三个连贯的记忆。第一个是在传说中的库布里塞蒂的毁灭景象。在白垩平原上，蔓延着他们最后的邪恶建筑，人蝎自己的倾倒偶像。我被迫在那里休息，疲惫不堪。我凝视着夜空，恐惧和疲惫交织在一起，听到了一只巨大盐背的脚步声。即使是那些巨兽也知道要避开这个地方。第二个记忆是巨人的存在。巨大的类人骨骼散布在沙漠中。我之前听说过这些描述，实际上有些样本一直延伸到奥德鲁姆以北。它们的历史对我们或任何人都完全未知，但它们的骨骼提供了盐滩上唯一的遮荫，因此它们成为了受欢迎的景象。所以，当我有一天晚上蜷缩在一个三具尸体的小范围内时，我惊恐地发现了一个真相。你看，所有尸体都有一个共同点: 它们的方向。向东向南。向东向南。第三个记忆是铁锈。生锈的船体和生锈的尖塔。我花了几个星期才意识到我看到的是什么。我整个童年都是在斯基蒂船和船只中度过的，但没有一艘有这么大。我想象着过去的景象，尽管对我来说毫无意义。莫格拉伊是一片广阔的海洋，巨大的船只乘风破浪。当时，它们船体上的标记和刻痕对我没有任何意义。但后来，我认出了纺锤的图案，并瞥见了这对这些海上食者的重要性。当我跌倒在地，被一个拿着刀并有一只发光猫的棕皮肤男人扶起来时，我知道这是个梦。一定是梦。我欠我的生命于=SEEKERENEMY=。为了尽快到达真菌林，我失足了。我漂浮不定的心灵使自己忽视了一个选民的存在。她靠近我，打算将我重新纳入其中，但被=SEEKERENEMY=拦截。我不知道他们干预的目的，但我要感谢他们。因此，他们肯定引起了长老的愤怒。我现在来到了库德和盲道追寻者。吟唱在我的脑中汇聚成最后的极乐，我加入了一个我无法想象的集体心智。我为此做好了准备。从多年前在埃廷斯皮恩的第一次结合，到自由先知主持的欢乐仪式，我知道视力并不比盐更重要。集体中有极乐，确实，长老是我所知道的最强大的中心。但中心仍然是中心，而中心意味着等级制度。我过去的哪一部分赋予了我识破骗局的智慧？是童年的回忆，海浪在歌曲之岸拍打，后来在莫格拉伊的幻象中回响？还是在伊布努德时自由先知眼中的嫉妒？或者只是集体心智中的一个皱纹，与我自己的斗争无关？我说不清楚，但当其他轻骑兵吹奏他们的歌曲以削弱长老的囚笼，成为更大心智的无知奴隶时，我逃走了。必须记住，能量不是一个简单的因素，而是两个因素的产物——一个具有速度的质量，一个具有温度的质量，一定量的电进入压力等等。有时人们会说物质和能量是两个现实；两者都被视为实体。更哲学的说法应该是物质和运动，因为没有运动就没有能量，能量随着运动量的变化而变化；此外，要理解任何能量的表现，必须询问涉及什么样的运动。当我们谈论机械能时，是指一个物体具有平动运动的能量；同样，当我们谈论热量时，是指振动运动，谈论光时，是指波动运动。不说明或暗示这些区别来谈论能量，就是说得太松散，远离实际知识。谈论一个物体拥有能量或消耗能量，就意味着该物体具有某种运动，并因为它有运动而对另一个物体产生压力。泰特和其他人指出，所谓的势能本质上必然是动能。泰特说——现在，无法想象一种真正休眠的能量形式，其大小以任何方式取决于时间单位；我们被迫得出结论，势能像动能一样，依赖于（即使无法解释或想象）运动。这一切意味着现在停止将能量视为任何现象的最终因素已经太晚了，体现能量的_运动形式_才是决定_发生什么_的因素，而不是_发生多少_的因素。在这里，可以找到以前称为力的区别；这里体现了直接压力使一个物体移动的证明，移动的方向取决于作用点相对于质心的位置。","Error: Unfortunately, you're banned by the community from uploading to the workshop!
